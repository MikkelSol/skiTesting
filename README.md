# Ski Testing Project

Alpine skiing is a sport where equipment and attention to detail are extremely important. The goal for this desktop application is for users to have an intuitive and easy way to record and track equipment performance. By having a useful equipment application, users are able to limit their time spent tracking the performance of their equipment and make it more convenient for athletes, coaches, and ski servicemen to find the best possible equipment combination.
